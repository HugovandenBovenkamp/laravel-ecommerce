<h1>Laravel ecommerce website</h1>
<hr>
<h2>This is a project created to learn laravel and its features.</h2>

<h3>This application requires the following:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>The user is able to create an account and login with their existing account.</li>
    <li>The user can put an item on the homepage in their "cart" and modify the cart, like removing items, deleting items or adding multiple of the same item.</li>
    <li>Use a payment method like cashier(stripe) to handle the payment.</li>
    <li>Use tailwind for the frontend and make it look responsive.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Challenges and things I want to learn :</h2>
<hr>

<ul>
    <li>When checking out, Adding multiple items of the already added item is something i think will be pretty challenging. Or just the CRUD functionality in general with a new laravel project will be really different then a regular php project.</li>
    <li>Using migrations and the ORM will be something I really want to learn this project. It is something different like just "Creating" a database.</li>
    <li>Using things like the php artisan to make controllers, migrations or import the login system?</li>
    <li>The frontend styling with tailwind will be something to get used to, this is something I haven't used a lot, so I chose to use it in this project to learn some front end as well. </li>
    <li>Using blade as the template engine, It will probably make my life a lot easier, but I never used something like this before. I always made my own html files and made the HTML and PHP structure myself.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Issues I encountered and Diary: </h2>
<hr>
<ul>
    <li>So I am going to start with making tailwindcss work inside of my laravel project. Beginning with making the frontend of the application. Where do I tell laravel I use tailwind?</li>
    <li>What will my page structure look like and how can I use blade for dividing my pages? Going to read how blade works on the documentation or watch a video explaining how blade works.</li>
</ul>
